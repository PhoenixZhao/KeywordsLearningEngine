KeywordsLearningEngine
======================
This is one part of Opinion Mining System, which was complished by three students. I was in charge of the keywords learning engine(KLE). This engine is meant to convert general keywords lexcion into domain specific lexicon, which could be used to predict poloarity, say positive or negative, under different domains, such as camear and mobile phones.

Based on statistic methods and using some basic ontologies and annotated data, the KLE caculated the polaries and generate domain-specific lexicons.

For example, in general, the word high carries postivie polarity. However, in the cameral market, when people say the price is high, they usually pose negative opinion on this product. Namely, in the domain of cameral, the word high carries negative polarity.
